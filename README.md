                                          Website Development; Explore Pakistan

**Description and Working:**

This website naming ‘Explore Pakistan’, is a tourism website having a main page as well as separate landing pages for each province of Pakistan. Main page includes top destinations, discounts, block diagrams, pictures and client reviews. Major tourist attractions, historic places, eating places, nearby hotels and maps will also be provided with each landmark mentioned per province. HTML, CSS and java script has been used to develop this website. 

**Motivation:**

Stepping in the 21st century, where everything is a touch away, we decided to take it as an opportunity and create something different which will ease the tourists with finding a perfect destination for their holidays just by opening this website and entering the province the want to explore! This will appeal our modern-day costumers as they do not want to hassle when searching for a perfect destination in the outskirts, another city or province. Such initiatives will promote the tourism industry of Pakistan.
